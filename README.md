## Hi there 👋, I'm Nicola della Volpe

### About Me 

I'm an MSc student at Politecnico di Milano with a strong interest in machine learning and deep learning. I have experience in C++ and Java, and enjoy tackling challenging problems with elegant and efficient code. In addition to my technical skills, I have honed my team working skills through my experience at Apple Developer Academy, where I collaborated with cross-functional teams to develop iOS apps.
